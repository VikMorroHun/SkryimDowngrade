Skyrim SE/AE/Fallout 4 Downgrade Utility
========================================
Revert games to older versions via Steam DepotDownloader.

### Can I run Skyrim Downgrade Utility while an account is already connected to Steam?
Any connection to Steam will be closed if they share a LoginID.  You can't specify a different LoginID with this program (although it is possible in DepotDownloader).

### Why doesn't my password containing special characters work?
If your password contains special characters, you will need to use appropriate escape sequences.

### I don't want to recompile the source code.  Where is the download link for the release version?
